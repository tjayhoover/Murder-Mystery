                    friends are all huddled in your living room watching a scary movie. As you all sit watching the
                    movie, your friend John Johnson announces that he is going to the bathroom. While he&#39;s gone,
                    lightning suddenly strikes the house and all of the power goes out. A wild scramble ensues to
                    get the power back on.</b></p>

                    you
                    notice John has still not returned. You start to call out for him, but he mysteriously doesn&#39;t
                    reply.
                    You and your friends start to throw out ideas as to why he isn&#39;t replying.</b></p>
