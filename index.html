           <p><b>It&#39;s October 31st&mdash;a dark and stormy night&mdash;and you and seven of your 
               friends are all huddled in your living room watching a scary movie. As you all sit watching the 
               movie, your friend John Johnson announces that he is going to the bathroom. While he&#39;s gone, 
               lightning suddenly strikes the house and all of the power goes out. A wild scramble ensues to 
               get the power back on.</b></p>

            <p><b>After a few minutes, the power comes back on, and a couple of you notice you are 
                hurt, including yourself&#59; you&#39;re bleeding from the head. After taking a minute to recover, you 
                notice John has still not returned, and start to call out for him, and he mysteriously doesn&#39;t reply. 
                You and your friends start to throw out ideas as to why he isn&#39;t replying.</b></p>
